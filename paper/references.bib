    abstract = {Major nations across the globe are increasingly concerned about the rising trends in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, particularly in societies of varying scales. Against this backdrop, precise prediction of carbon emissions becomes critically important, especially for the formulation and adjustment of near-term carbon reduction policies. However, the non-linear, non-stationary, and complex nature of daily carbon emission data poses a great challenge for daily-level forecasting especially in the big data context. To address this issue, we propose a novel composite forecasting approach named DCEF dedicated to the estimation of daily carbon emissions. In concrete, our approach employs the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for data stabilization and the Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for forecasting, while integrating the Truncated singular value decomposition(TSVD) technique for data compression and mitigating noise. Finally, DCEF is empirically validated with real daily carbon emission datasets collected from 6 sectors in 13 countries of varying sizes. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our approach compared to other baseline models in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency.}

  	abstract = {Predicting the economic implications of gas emissions and their repercussions is criti-cal to policymakers, especially given the current increasing trend in volume. Therefore, study on gas emission prediction is required. A hybrid model is proposed for forecasting CO2 emissions of Bahrain (BH) in this study. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average are the two techniques that make up the hybrid model (ARIMA). In this model, the time series of CO2 emissions are first divided into a number of sub-series corresponding to some tendentious and oscillation (periodic or quasi-periodic) components and noise by using SSA. Each sub-series is then predicted individually through an appropriate ARIMA model. Finally, a correction procedure is carried out for the sum of the prediction results to ensure that the superposed residual is a pure random series. The result of forecasting obtained by using hybrid SSA-ARIMA was compared with ARIMA to assess its superiority. While, the application of SSA was to improve the accuracy of forecasting of CO2 emissions in BH. The data used in this study are the annual time series data in three different periods from 1990-2018, 2000-2018 and 2003-2018 for CO2 emissions in BH. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) criteria are used to assess each forecasting method{\textquoteright}s level of forecasting accuracy. The results indicated that the SSA-ARIMA method is superior to the ARIMA model as the best forecasting method for CO2 emis-sions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = {As global warming intensifies, the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases have attracted great global attention. However, questions regarding whether, how and to what extent demographic factors and processes affect carbon emissions have not yet been fully explained – particularly in China. This study used an improved STIRPAT model to reassess the impact of demographic and income changes on China’s energy-related CO2 emissions at the national and regional levels using balanced provincial panel data from the 1990–2012 period. Whereas most previous studies of emission–population/income elasticity in China have yielded wide-ranging estimates, this study showed that income rather than demographic change has been the dominant driving force behind China’s growing CO2 emissions. Urbanisation has increased energy consumption and emissions, except in western China. Changes in the age structure have had a statistically insignificant effect on energy use, but resulted in increased national emissions – particularly in eastern China. Shrinking household size did not reduce energy use and emissions, indicating that improved residential energy efficiency might reduce emissions. Changing the traditional mode of economic growth, reasonable controlling the pace of urbanisation, improving energy efficiency and upgrading industrial structures may yet be necessary to mitigate the environmental impact of human activities in China.}

    abstract = { Theoretically, population growth is believed to increase greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2 emissions through the increase in human activities. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate this assertion in Nigeria using an autoregressive distributed lag model covering periods from 1971-2000, 1971-2005, and 1971-2010 recursively. The results indicated that population was not a determinant of CO2 emissions in all the three periods in the long run. However, economic growth was found to be the only long-run CO2 emissions determining factor within the studied periods. However, in the short run, virtually all the explanatory variables and their lags, that is, population growth, economic growth, and energy consumption, were significant in determining CO2 emissions. The findings suggested that population growth, which is the focal point of the study, could only determine CO2 emissions in the short run. Therefore, population checking measures could be a short-run effective measure to lower the emissions level. Also, further research should be conducted on how to effectively and efficiently manage the population growth–CO2 emissions relationship. }

To do so, an unbalanced panel dataset of 128 countries over the period 1990–2014 is utilized. Considering the cross-sectional dependence and slope homogeneity observed in the panel, a series of econometric techniques allowing for cross-sectional dependence and slope homogeneity is employed. The results of cross-sectional dependence and slope homogeneity tests confirm the existence of significant cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity. The empirical results of the common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) estimator indicate that, at both the global and regional levels, population size and economic growth positively and significantly influence CO2 emission levels. Furthermore, although increased renewable energy intensity leads to a decline in CO2 emissions for all of the six regions, its coefficient in S. & Cent. America and Europe & Eurasia is considerably higher than the levels seen in other regions, which may be affected by the proportion of renewable energy in the primary energy mix. Finally, the results of panel causality testing provide evidence of varied causality links among the variables across regions.}

Yet policy makers largely ignore the potential of fertility changes and population growth when designing policies to limit climate disruption and lessen its impacts. Here we argue that rights-based policy interventions could decrease fertility rates to levels consistent with low population pathways. We review country and global level studies that explore the effects of low population pathways on climate change mitigation and adaptation. We then provide rights-based policy recommendations, such as the expansion of voluntary family planning programs that incorporate elements from successful past programs, and highlight current research gaps. In concert with policies that end fossil fuel use and incentivize sustainable consumption, humane policies that slow population growth should be part of a multifaceted climate response. These policies require attention from scientists, policy analysts and politicians.}
